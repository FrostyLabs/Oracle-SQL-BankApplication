# Oracle SQL Coursework
SET09107: Advanced Database Systems - Coursework

This coursework had us redesign a banking entity relational database into an object relational database. 

----------------

# How this repository works: 

1. Setup database: run reset_tables.sql 
2. Add member functions to types: run alter_types.sql 
3. Populate tables with data: run insert_data.sql 
4. Queries for coursework found in Coursework.sql

Each table is populated with a minimum of 20 rows.

### Notes:

* I used SQL Developer version: 17.4.0
