SET09107 Coursework

----------------

How this repository works: 

1. Setup database: run reset_tables.sql 
2. Add member functions to types: run alter_types.sql 
3. Populate tables with data: run insert_data.sql 
4. Queries for coursework found in Coursework.sql

Each table is populated with a minimum of 20 rows.

### Notes: 
* report.pdf is the writeup for this coursework. 
* cw-ads_18.pdf is the coursework specification. 
* I used SQL Developer version: 17.4.0
